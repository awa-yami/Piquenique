<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p class="recuo"><i>Hello, welcome to my website. My name is Yamí and I'm 25 years old. I'm studying Applied Foreign Languages at UnB and grew up in Brasília. If you're the kind of person who likes to picnic like me, you're in the best place to discover good places to do so in the Cruzeiro neighborhood and in the Sudoeste/Octogonal neighborhood area. What's more, you'll see some great places to visit near the picnic sites. </i></p><p class="recuo">The locations have been selected because they arouse some affection in the creator of this site.</p>
<h1>Picnic Spots</h1>
<section id="parque_da_cidade">
<h2>Dona Sarah Kubitschek City Park</h2>
<p class="recuo">The first place I would recommend is the City Park -Parque da Cidade-, the largest urban park in Latin America with approximately 420 hectares designed by landscape architect Burle Marx incorporating elements of the Cerrado biome, using native species. Others responsible for the park's design were urban planner Lúcio Costa, architect Oscar Niemeyer and artist Athos Bulcão. The park was founded on October 11, 1978.
<p class="recuo">The City Park has a number of attractions for all ages, such as barbecue areas, sports courts, playgrounds, squares, lakes, an Equestrian Center, restaurants and an extensive Exhibition Pavilion. The venue receives an average of 14,000 people from Monday to Friday and 37,000 at weekends. During special events, the attendance rises to 80,000, according to the DF Secretariat for Sport and Leisure.
<p class="recuo">The park has many green areas, trees that provide shade and water mirrors that make the weather milder and more comfortable. The park also has 16 rest stops with toilets designed by Glauco Campello along its 10 km of running and cycling paths. The masonry walls of the rest stops are covered with a panel of tiles created by Athos Bulcão. The park is located between the Asa Sul neighborhood in Plano Piloto and the Sudoeste Sector. It's very busy and there are lots of food stalls. 
<p class="recuo"><i>I particularly enjoy going out with friends in this park, rollerblading, walking, chatting... and then we take a cane, a cloth, spread out on the grass and under a tree for shade, and have a snack together. It's very relaxing. That's leisure. But watch out for anthills when you leave your yoke on the grass. I'd also recommend taking care of the time of day, as there are mosquitoes from dusk onwards.</i></p>
<p class="recuo"><i>When I was a child, my family and I used to cycle along the park's cycle paths. We did this on holidays or at weekends. It was one of the main places to spend quality time together.</i></p>
<figure><img src="source/imagem parque da cidade internet.jpeg" alt="In the photograph there are many trees, most of them mango trees. The grass and leaves are an intense color. There's a barbecue, posts and about fifteen people." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the Google Maps website. It shows people gathered as a family having a picnic in the area of the old forest near parking lot 5.</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="source/vista_parque da cidade.jpg" alt="In the photograph, the grass is not its usual green color, but burnt yellow, showing that it was taken during the dry season. There is also an artificial lake with an intense blue color. The field is relatively ‘clean’ with few trees." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the official website of the DF Department of Sport and Leisure. It shows a wide view of the City Park. The image was probably taken during the dry season by a drone. </figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="source/PARQUE DA CIDADE.BANHEIRO.jpg" alt="In addition to the rest stop, you can see the sidewalk and the current track next to the stop. You can see people at the end of the track and a person standing next to the stop." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the Athos Bulcão Foundation website in 1985. In it you can see the rest stop with bench and toilet and its tiled walls.</figcaption></figure>

Here you can get a closer look at the details of the tiles on the wall of a rest stop.</figcaption></figure>

<section id="parque_pista_de_skate"></section>
<h2>Sukata Skate Park</h2>
<p class="recuo">The Sukata Skate Park -Pista de Skate Sukata-, or Skate Park, as it is popularly known, is located between the Octogonal and Cruzeiro Novo neighborhoods. It has a skate park covering more than 1,500 m², and is the oldest skate park in the Federal District. There is also a community meeting point where residents can exercise on the equipment. There are also benches, trees and grass for picnics. The skate park has recently undergone a refurbishment and from time to time there are rock concerts and skate culture events. 
<p class="recuo">The location is next to the shopping center <i>Terraço Shopping</i>, where there is the <i>Lojas Americanas</i> convenience store and the <i>Daiso</i> store and next to the <i>Veneza</i> supermarket, which can be good options if you want to buy a snack nearby quickly and reasonably cheaply.</p>
<p class="recuo"><i>During my childhood, as my brother and some of my friends nearby were skateboarders and would occasionally go to the skate park, I would end up going there too, even though I was never interested in skateboarding. A few years later, when exercise equipment was installed in the park near the skate park, I went back there with my mother to walk and exercise. It was well frequented in the early years, but then it lost its regulars.</i> </p>
<figure><img src="source/parque sukata.JPG" alt="In this photograph, you can see lots of trees with thin trunks, a lamppost and a short track that leads to the skate park. The grass is not very green" class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the Google Maps website. Here you can see the park with a distant view of the skate park.</figcaption></figure>
<br><figure><img src="source/pista de skate_parque sukata.jpeg" alt="In the photo you can see the track made with recent concrete. There is an elevation in the middle for maneuvering." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the <i>acorda DF</i> website. The runway underwent a recent renovation in 2023.
<br> The image shows a skateboarder performing a maneuver as he descends the ramp.</figcaption></figure>
<br><figure><img src="source/parque sukata_show.JPG" alt="In the photograph you can see about ten people with their skateboards huddled in front of the stage carrying a friend on their shoulders, while there are two musicians playing on stage." class="fotos"> <figcaption>Image by Leandro Lima taken from the Sukata Skate Park page on the social network Instagram. In it, the trash metal band <i>Transtorno Nuclear</i> played at the park by invitation.
<section id="parque_urbano"></section>
<h2> Octogonal Urban Park</h2>
<p class="recuo"> The Octogonal Urban Park -Parque Urbano Octogonal- is located on Lot 04 of Entrequadra 03/08 of the Octogonal Areas in the Southwest/Octogonal Administrative Region. It is in the center of the neighborhood, between the Octogonal condominiums. A reference point to find it more easily is Terraço Shopping, located behind it.  The park was made official by law in the District Council of the Federal District in 2021. The creation of the park is the result of interest and pressure from the neighborhood's residents to continue taking advantage of this preserved area.
<p class="recuo">The park has garbage cans and I find it very clean and safe. It also has the <i>Rainha da Paz</i> parish. Os frequentadores do parque levam seus pets para se divertir, se exercitar. Outros levam seus filhos, sobrinhos para jogar bola, vôlei ou três cortes. What's more, having a family picnic at sunset seems like a great way to spend your free time.</p>
<p class="recuo"><i>When I was a child, I used to walk through the park to go to school in primary school. I can still remember the smell of all the ultra-processed snacks. What's more, I remember that after school, as I passed the park on my way home, the sun was already low, almost setting. The sky was orange, even violet in some places. On the way, I noticed that the earth was - still is - red, bare, without the grass cover. Next to the school, perpendicular to the road, there was a metal fence covered by plants, leaves that didn't reveal what was inside the condominiums.</i></p>
<figure><img src="source/vista_parque urbano octogonal.jpg" alt="In the photo you can see some trees, as well as the red earth. There is also a trash can" class="fotos">
<br><figcaption></figcaption>Authorial image taken in the late afternoon with a view of the neighborhood buildings in the center of the park. It's a wide field with plenty of space.</figure> 
<br><figure><br><img src="source/pai e filho_ parque urbano octogonal.jpg" alt="The photo shows that it was taken in the late afternoon, as you can see rays of sunlight on the grass and trees. You can also see a bit of the red earth." class="fotos"><figcaption>Authorial image taken in the late afternoon. It shows a father and son playing <i>três cortes</i>. This part of the park is close to the <i>Ciman</i> school.</figcaption></figure>
<br><figure><img src="source/outra vista_ parque urbano octogonal.jpg" alt="In this photograph, most of it is covered by dry grass and the sun's rays, so it's very clear. In the background you can see trees and buildings." class="fotos"><figcaption>Authorial image taken in the late afternoon with a more distant view of the <i>Ciman</i> school and the <i>AOS 08</i> condominium.</figcaption></figure> 
<br><figure><img src="source/vista_nossa senhora da paz.JPG" alt="In addition to the park in the background, you can see buildings in the Octogonal neighborhood." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the <i>Google Maps</i> website. It houses the <i>Rainha da Paz-Octogonal</i> parish. You can also see the Urban Park behind it. </figcaption></figure>
<br><figure><img src="source/paróquia rainha da paz_octogonal.jpg" alt="Photo taken inside the parish. The seats are wooden and padded. You can also see a small white altar with an elevation on the right-hand side opposite the seats." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken inside the parish during the afternoon. Here you can see the stained-glass windows illuminated by the sun and the image of the saint <i>Rainha da Paz</i>.</figcaption></figure>
<section id="praça_do_cruzeiro"></section>
<br><h1>Cruzeiro Square</h1> 
<p class="recuo"> The Cruzeiro Square -Praça do Cruzeiro- is 1,172 meters above sea level, making it one of the highest areas in the Federal District. It was founded in 1956 during the construction of the new capital, and was one of the most visited places due to its privileged location where you could see the construction work in the central region. 
<p class="recuo"> Today, the place is very popular for spending leisure time because it has food options such as foodtrucks, with options such as hamburgers, fries and spirits. It's also a popular spot for a privileged view of the sunset from a cane or bench on the lawn next to the square, and also, of course, for a picnic.</p>   
<p class="recuo"><i>This place is the least affective for me, as it's where I've spent the least time. However, as I passed by on the bus, I always noticed it. I found it strange because it was always empty, unpopulated in the middle of the lawn. So it was a surprise to learn that the place was being well frequented by foodtrucks.</i></p>
<br><figure><img src="source/vista_praça do cruzeiro.jpg" alt="Photo probably taken in the late afternoon. The sky is very cloudy. There are some trees between the memorial and the square." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the <i>flickr</i> website. This is an approximate view of the cross in the center of Cruzeiro Square, with the JK Memorial in the background.</figcaption></figure>
<br><figure><img src="source/pessoas fazendo picnic_praça do cruzeiro.jpg" alt="Na fotografia é possível ver o gramado seco e muitas pessoas em pé, sentadas contemplando o pôr do sol." class="fotos"><figcaption>Authorial image taken at sunset with a view of the lawn and trees, as well as the exuberant sky. This spot is located next to the Cruzeiro Square crossing the return between the two roads of the Eixo Monumental.</figcaption></figure> 
<br><figure><img src="source/cruz no escuro_praça do cruzeiro.jpg" alt="The photo is very dark, so you can only see part of the sky and the shape of the cross in the center. " class="fotos"><figcaption>Authorial image taken at the end of the sunset from the cross in the Cruzeiro Square.</figcaption></figure>
<br> <figure><img src="source/food truck_praça do cruzeiro.webp"alt="In this photograph you can see tents and the cross in the square. The sky is an intense orange, indicating that it was taken at sunset. There are also poles." class="fotos"><figcaption>Image taken from the <i>Correio Braziliense</i> news website. It shows people dancing in front of a foodtruck selling hamburgers in the Cruzeiro Square.</figcaption></figure>
